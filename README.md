This project is a component of the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. Read more in the [introduction blog post](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework).

# Operator SDK Samples
This repo contains samples of operators built using the [operator-sdk][operator_sdk].

To view operators which leverage Ansible or Helm for deployment, see the [Ansible][ansible_examples] or [Helm][helm_examples] samples sections.
